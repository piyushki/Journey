## 👤 About Me

I work in **web security**, focused on **web application penetration testing** and **bug bounty research**.  
My approach is analysis-first, not scanner-driven.

## 🔍 What I Work On

- Reconnaissance and attack surface mapping  
- JavaScript analysis for hidden endpoints and logic flow  
- Authentication and authorization weaknesses  
- Session handling and access control flaws  
- IDOR, business logic bugs, and privilege escalation  
- API and GraphQL security testing  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Environment

- **Burp Suite** (primary interception and analysis)
- **Kali Linux**
- Browser DevTools for JavaScript reverse analysis
- Custom scripts for recon and automation where necessary

---

## 🧠 Methodology

I prefer **reading and understanding code** over blind fuzzing.  
JavaScript bundles, API behavior, and application logic are treated as first-class attack surfaces.

Targets are not black boxes.  
Understanding comes before exploitation.
