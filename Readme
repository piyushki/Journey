## About Me

My name is **Piyush Kumar Khosla**. I focus on **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing**.

I have built a solid foundation in **Web Application Security**, but progress has occasionally stalled due to gaps in consistency and hands-on execution. This repository exists to correct that.

The objective is simple:
- Shift from theory to practice  
- Enforce consistency over motivation  
- Build discipline through daily execution  

This repository documents my **daily routine, experiments, and progress**. The structure and methods will evolve, but consistency is non-negotiable.

It serves two purposes:
- A verifiable record of my learning journey  
- A transparent log others can reference, audit, or learn from  

This is not a showcase. It is a system for long-term growth.
