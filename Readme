About Me

My name is Piyush Kumar Khosla, and I am passionate about Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing.

Although I have built a solid foundation in Web Application Security, I often find myself feeling stuck for various reasons. To overcome this, I created this repository as a way to become more practical, and most importantly, more consistent in my learning and work.

Here, I document my daily routine and progress. While I know my approach will evolve over time, the main goal is to remain consistent at any cost.

This repository also serves as both a record of my journey and a way to share my growth with others. I hope it proves useful or inspiring to anyone who comes across it.
